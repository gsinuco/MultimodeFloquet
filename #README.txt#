This library implements the multimode floquet approach to calculate the
time-evolution operator of a time-dependent quantum system with discrete 
spectrum, where the time-dependence is given by a superposition of harmonically
oscillating terms.

HOW TO INSTALL

A simple Makefile is included in the distribution. As a requiremen,
your system should have LAPACK. The library also builds an sparse representatino
of the Hamiltonian, such that the intel MKL can be used for diagonalization.

For installation you should specify the path to the library and include of the 
MKL library. 

the library is build with the command:

make lib

This command will build all needed object files, put toghether the file
lib/libmultimodefloquet.a and copy the fortran modules in the directory 
include/.


Examples are in the folders examples/FORTRAN and examples/CPP. In each 
directory, a Makefile takes care of creating executables.
